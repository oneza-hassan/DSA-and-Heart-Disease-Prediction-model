# DSA and Heart Disease Prediction Model 💻❤️

![Made with Love by Oneza Hassan Alvi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with%20❤️%20by-Oneza%20Hassan%20Alvi-red)

This repository combines fundamental Data Structures implementations with an applied Machine Learning project developed during my Bioinformatics studies at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad.

## 📚 Repository Contents

### 🧠 Data Structures (From DSA Course)
- `single_linked_list.py` - Complete implementation with operations
- `double_linked_list.py` - Implementation with common methods

### ❤️ Heart Disease Predictor
- GUI application using Logistic Regression
- Clinical decision support features
- Prediction logging system

## 🚀 Features

**Data Structures:**
- Clean, well-commented implementations
- Common operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
- Demonstrations of linked list concepts

**Heart Disease Prediction:**
- Intuitive Tkinter interface
- Clinical safety checks that override model when needed
- Persistent prediction logging
- Help system for medical parameters
- Model probability outputs

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oneza-hassan/DSA-and-Heart-Disease-Prediction-model.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd DSA-and-Heart-Disease-Prediction-model/heart_disease_predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python heart_disease_app.py
```

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (included as `heart.csv`)
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## 🏥 Usage Instructions
1. Fill in all patient parameters
2. Click "?" buttons for field-specific help
3. Click "Analyze Heart Risk" for prediction
4. Review clinical warnings (if any)
5. Save results to the log file

## 🔧 Note on Model Performance
The current model achieves basic performance but could benefit from:
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Alternative algorithms
- Cross-validation improvements

**Contributions welcome!** I'd appreciate any commits that improve the model's accuracy or functionality.

## 👩‍🎓 Academic Background
Developed by **Oneza Hassan Alvi** during my Bioinformatics studies at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. Combines work from:
- Data Structures and Algorithms course (linked lists)
- Final year machine learning coursework (predictor)
